# Best Way to Sharpen an Axe

## Intro

Chances are good that if you’ve found your way to this post, you have an axe you want to sharpen, but you’re not sure how. You also don’t want just any way to sharpen it, you want the BEST way.

This isn’t the only way to sharpen an axe, and there are many techniques that all yield the same result. However, the way I am about to show you is low cost, produces a razor sharp edge, is very portable, and also does not require power of any kind. All of these reasons make it hard to beat.

Anyone new to axe sharpening can find all of the details about the necessary tools for this method in my previous post [Axe Sharpening Tools](https://realaxe.siterubix.com/axe-sharpening-tools/), but I’ll quickly list them here. In this post, I’m going to show you how to take your axe from dull to razor sharp in three simple steps: Shaping the axe bit, honing the blade, and stropping the cutting edge.

Necessary Tools:

- Gloves
- Clamp or Vise
- Bastard file
- File brush
- Whetstone
- Leather strop

## Shaping the Axe Bit

The shape of the axe bit is very important. If the blade is too thick, it will be difficult to get a sharp edge and the axe won’t bite into the wood. If the blade is too thin, it will easily break or chip. The ideal shape from a top-down view can be seen below in Figure 2. This blade profile offers the most durability while allowing for steep enough angle for a sharp enough edge to bite wood effectively.

Now that we know what the goal is, we can start working toward it. The first step is to check the blade shape. If the top down view of your axe blade looks correct and there isn’t much work to be done to get your axe sharp, this first step can be skipped. But if your axe has any knicks, chips, or is extremely dull and needs some material removed to thin the tip of the edge, you’ll need to use the file. **Make sure to wear gloves, especially when using the file because you will be pushing in the direction of the blade.**

Using a clamp, vise, or some other method of holding the axe in place, fasten it at a comfortable working height as in Figure 3. Hold the file so the coarse side is contacting the blade and in one smooth motion, push the file toward the blade at the correct angle. This method does not remove material quickly so don’t be nervous about ruining the blade. As long as you have the file close to the right angle to achieve the profile depicted in Figure 2, you will be able to adjust as you continue filing. Printing out the image above to use as a reference will ensure you do not file too much. Make sure you work both sides of the blade so the edge remains centered. If the file becomes loaded with metal shavings, use the file brush to clean it.

Once you’ve shaped the blade to match the sharpening gauge, flip the file to the less coarse side and repeat the process of filing both sides of the blade. The fine side will remove even less material and should be used to get a very sharp tool, even before using the whetstone. An axe can be sufficiently sharpened only using a file, but honing with whetstone will reduce the burr that develops on the edge and allow for even greater performance.

## Honing the Blade

Once you’ve finished shaping the bit with a file, or once you’ve determined filing the blade isn’t necessary, the whetstone can be used to hone the axe. If an axe is cared for properly, filing will rarely need to be done and a whetstone will suffice to touch up the blade.

Whetstones rely on water to carry away the metal shavings and to keep the whetstone from getting loaded. I recommend soaking your whetstone for 5 minutes before using it, but simply wetting the surface of the stone will be fine. Even spitting on the stone will work if you’re in a pinch!

These stones generally have a light side and a dark side. The dark is more coarse than the light. Like with the file, start with the coarse side of the stone. Angle the stone so that it contacts the tip of the blade. Move the stone in small circles from one end of the blade to the other. Alternate sides, attempting to work both sides evenly. Repeat with the light side of the stone. If you notice that your stone is dry, dip it in water.

At this point in the process, you have a sharp edge with a burr on it. This burr reduces how sharp the blade feels, as well as how well it performs. Next we’ll go over how to remove this burr.

## Stropping the Cutting Edge

You’ve probably heard of stropping, but associate it primarily with straight razor shaving. Stropping can actually be done to most or all blades. Its primary purpose is to remove the burr that forms on the edge throughout the sharpening process. Typically, strops are made of leather, but many materials can act as a strop. A regular 2x4 or even your arm can be used as a strop.

Once reason leather works really well though is because you can actually buy honing compound to rub into the leather. It comes in different levels of coarseness and acts like a polish because the particles are so fine.

If you have some leather, take a piece about 1.5 feet long by 4-6 inches and simply adhere it to a flat piece of wood for stability. Make sure the rougher side is facing up because this is the side that the honing compound will be rubbing into. Once the adhesive is dry, rub some polishing compound into the leather. The compound isn’t necessary, but this strop can be used on any other blades you might want to sharpen in the future so if you’re making one, you might as well grab some honing compound while you’re at it!

Now that you have a strop or a 2x4, we can walk through the technique. Take the axe blade and just like with the whetstone, make sure the tip of the blade is contacting the stropping surface. Slowly pull the axe away from the cutting edge like in Figure 4. Flip it over to the other side and repeat. Do this 10-20 times per side of the blade and that’s it.

Make sure you don’t pull the blade all the way to the edge of the strop so that it falls off the strop. This will roll or bend the sharp edge that you’ve worked so hard on and dull it.

Outline:

1. Intro - The best way to sharpen an axe is with a file and a sharpening stone because it can be done anywhere and the tools required are easy to carry with you. Once you’ve learned the technique, it is just as effective as using a grinding wheel of any kind. In this post, I’m going to show you how to correctly sharpen your axe using just a double sided file and a whetstone as the abrasives. I’ll list the tools required, but if you want more details on each of the items, check out my post about Axe Sharpening Tools(&lt;-Link text).
