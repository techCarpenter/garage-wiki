# Niche Process

## Step 1: Audit yourself

Here are some of my favorite prompts to get you started:

- The labels that most define me are…
- I feel like I belong when I’m with…
- It breaks my heart when I see…
- I’m endlessly curious about…
- The problems I’m most proud of overcoming are…

Spend at least 20-30 minutes freewriting your way through those prompts, and I guarantee you’ll have more niche ideas than you know what to do with.

## Step 2: Form a niche hypothesis

> Niche: a group of people congregating around one or more shared characteristics.

When you look over all the ideas and groups you brainstormed in step one, which one immediately grabs you? Which one makes your heart flutter a bit? Which do you feel most drawn towards, as if by sheer magnetism?

## Step 3: Validating your niche hypothesis

### How to conduct high level research

By now, you should have a niche hypothesis. The first stage to validating it is high level research.

There are three questions you need to answer in this stage.

1. Does this niche actually exist? (Is there already a market around this idea?)
2. If so, is that market big enough to support my business/financial goals?
3. Is it active and engaged? (ie. are people already consuming and conversing?)

If, after your research, you can answer yes to each of these, you’re good to go. You’ve got yourself a viable market, and you can move on to deep dive research.
