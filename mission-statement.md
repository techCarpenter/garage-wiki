# Mission Statement

## Made with help of the [mission statement generator](https://msb.franklincovey.com/).

I am at my best when I am thinking of others first.

I will try to prevent times when I belittle myself.

I will enjoy my work by finding employment where I can interact with other people and make substantial contributions.

I will find enjoyment in my personal life through spending quality time with my family and exploring my ideas.

I will find opportunities to use my natural talents and gifts such as creativity, being a good friend, and thoughtfulness.

I can do anything I set my mind to. I will become financially independent and decouple my income from my time.

My life's journey is striving to be a good steward of the gifts God has given to me and leading my family to do the same.

I will be a person who is excited to try new things and talk about how God has blessed me.

My most important future contribution to others will be strong christian leadership of my family.

I will stop procrastinating and start working on:

1. Not giving up so easily when I run stuck on problems at work.
2. Consistently leading my family in prayer and bible reading.

I will strive to incorporate the following attributes into my life:

- Spritual leadership
- Tenacity
- Patience

I will constantly renew myself by focusing on the four dimensions of my life:

- **Physical:** Take walks, exercise, and play with my kids
- **Spiritual:** Read the bible and pray with my wife every day
- **Mental:** Revisit my goals often and talk them through with my wife
- **Social/Emotional:** Spend time with friends and family 2 or more times per week
