# Ebomb Topic Checklist

Set up a place where you can start adding potential Ebomb topics as you find them on Safari. We really like using a Trello board for this!

When you add a topic to your Trello board (or wherever), here’s a few things to double check:

- [ ] What’s the **specific pain** your Ebomb is addressing? Could you **point to an example** of that pain in your watering holes?
- [ ] If a topic **requires explaining a lot of other things** to make your point, get more specific, so your Ebomb doesn’t wander.
- [ ] No fix, no Ebomb. What fix will this topic give your audience? **Decide the “win” first** and work backwards from there.

## The 7 Questions to Ask When Defining Your Target Audience

1. Will the product solve a very specific and acknowledged market need?
2. Is the product targeted at a specific kind of person?
3. Can I identify a specific person who needs the problem solved?
4. Is this specific person (my target customer) seeking a solution to their problem and willing (and able) to pay to have it solved?
5. Can I easily reach my target audience?
6. Are there enough members of my target audience to build a business?
7. Can I actually help my target customer solve their problem?
