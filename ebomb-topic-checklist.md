# Ebomb Topic Checklist

Set up a place where you can start adding potential Ebomb topics as you find them on Safari. We really like using a Trello board for this!

When you add a topic to your Trello board (or wherever), here’s a few things to double check:

- [ ] What’s the specific pain your Ebomb is addressing? Could you point to an example of that pain in your watering holes?
- [ ] If a topic requires explaining a lot of other things to make your point, get more specific, so your Ebomb doesn’t wander.
- [ ] No fix, no Ebomb. What fix will this topic give your audience? Decide the “win” first and work backwards from there.
