### Data

Questions and Answers that lead you straight to the customer's pain (and value)

## 3. How do you get it... fast? and _without_ fail?

> Get the most out of the gold you've already got!

### 1. Answer these questions to gather your raw data

**(Write answers with pen and paper!)**

- What do your future customers need?
- What is **one thing** people in your industry...
  - need to know?
  - fail to do?
  - waste time on?
  - always eff up?
  - bitch about?
  - don't understand?
  - don't have time for?
  - love achieving?
  - feel great about?
  - consider "successful"?
- What's one thing that makes them...
  - lose money?
  - more money?

> Pro Tip: You don't need to be a "visionary"... just identify problems and help people

### 2. Figure out where your customer's world intersects yours

Their pain + your sills = ✨💰

- Pain: where do they suck?
- You: where could you slide in?
- Win: what could they win?

#### The insight process

1. Take all the raw data you gathered (above)
2. Divide it into _pains_ (fails) and _wins_ (positive outcomes)
3. Fill out this madlib for as many of the _pains_/_wins_ as you can:
   - People in my industry suck at `_______`, but if only they’d `_______`, like me they’d have `_______`
4. You’ll generate a LOT of these insights, but pick _JUST ONE PAIN_ to tackle!

> Pro Tip: Your goal is $10k... Not a revolution (And you don't have to be an expert to help someone, just better than they are!)

### 3. Choose a single approach to reducing or eliminating one pain

- How will you help them kill that pain?

```text
            MINDSET : They think productively about their work/industry
    KNOWLEDGE/FACTS : They have all the pure facts and knowledge they require
SKILL/ABILITY LEVEL : They have the skills they require AND are good at them
     IMPLEMENTATION : They easily apply the skills they have to real-world projects
          EXECUTION : They easily start, persist, and finish those projects
            PROCESS : They follow a step-by-step process for reproducible success
           TEMPLATE : They have the code, design elements, writing, etc. they need
               TOOL : They have the tools they need to execute quickly and accurately
```

#### The Method Process

1. Take the _ONE PAIN_ you chose.
2. Read each of the above method statements above, aloud.
3. Make a note every time one is a blatant lie! Like so:
   1. **"They have all the skills they need - AND! - are good at them...?"** Ha! They couldn't `_______` if their lives depended on it. Sure, they can `_______`, but they're still newbies
4. Of the methods you wrote down, pick the _ONE_ you feel most comfy producing.

> REMEMBER: You goal is to save them 10 hours of work or money, not totally make over their life

### 4. Design a small, sharp delivery mechanism for the method

- How will you package the method?
  - Screencast
  - Webinar
  - Mini workshop
  - Audio lessons
  - Parts library
  - Themes
  - Plugin
  - Tool
  - Scripts
  - Checklists
  - Workbook
  - Mini book
  - Single feature app

#### The Product Process

1. Inventory your skills: What comest _EASIEST_ to you? Fastest? Best?
2. Inventory your byproducts: What _GOOD STUFF_ (code/design/words/slides/spreadsheets/processes/template) have you already made for your work?
3. How can you deliver on **THE METHOD** in _ONE_ work week, or 35 hours?
4. **OUTLINE** your simple product: What skills will you teach? What chapters, videos, etc. will that require? What is the one feature your toll will offer? What other things are required to ship? How will you charge? What will the interface be?
5. Cut ruthlessly. And then cut it down some more.

**DON'T OVERDO IT. KEEP IT SMALL AND SHARP. Your goal: save them 10-15 hours of work or money**

> DO NOT - REPEAT - DO NOT GET CARRIED AWAY WITH YOUR PRODUCT SCOPE
> This is not your _magnum opus_: more product die than are ever born

## 4. Execute!

- **Design, build, launch, ship... in 12 weeks**
  - Break it down into chunks and hustle your buns off!

# Stacking the Bricks email course

## Email #1 - Commitment that lasts

Okay, Brian!

We are here to help you kick your fears to the curb and ship a product that makes sales. The Year of Hustle Roadmap shows you the individual steps...but there's something in between the steps.

The _Year of Hustle Roadmap_ shows you what work to do. But it's not just "steps to follow" - it's a new way of thinking. A mindset of doing small things now, that add up over time towards a bigger goal. We call that "Stacking the Bricks."

This free email course is to help do just that!

There are three steps required to create any major change:

1. **Committing**
2. Preparing to win
3. Executing (over the long haul)

You're at step 1. That is an awesome place to be.

That's where you build the power for the rest of the steps which — let's be honest — aren't as sexy.

It's very, very easy to get stuck at Committing. It's fun to get fired up. Motivation feels awesome. It's satisfying to Prepare to Win… but it's not as sexy, and there's waaaaay less support for it, too.

Ever started out strong and fizzled out? Well, this is why. Our culture sucks at teaching us how to succeed. But if you capture that fiery motivating feeling, you can encase it in amber and use it to drive you forward for your Year of Hustle.

So while you're here, let us help you get over the traps and stumbling blocks along the way to step 2.

There are two steps you can complete now that will make a HUGE difference in your ability to create the life you want.

You wanna keep your fire going? Do these two steps today.

**Step 1. Stoke the pain til it burns hot like a thousand suns.**

Seriously. We grow up learning to not rock the boat. That learning is deeply embedded and hard as hell to undo.

Everything in your brain and body is going to try to make you forget how you feel right now. So you can go back to being "safe." So you can do nothing, and go nowhere.

Your subconscious is going to preserve the status quo at all costs.

Don't let it. Kill the status quo dead by embracing your F*ck This Moment.

And then...

**Step 2. Put your commitment where your face is.**

Warning: This is super cheesy and also crazy effective.

Now, while the feeling is hot, write it down. Dump all the things you hate about your current situation onto paper — yes, paper. Lay it all out so your subconscious can't bury it under a rock again and hide it from you.

You can't change something if you won't even let yourself see the truth. So go ahead, throw yourself a little pity party. Get angry about the things that suck the life out of you. Make the iron hot by striking.

Then, on a fresh page, **write down the powerful reason that will _keep you going_ when things get tough.**

Is it creative freedom? To fully execute on your work, for once, without tampering or endless meetings where you have to justify your very existence? To be the one who profits off your own labor? To interact with happy customers? To live and work where you want? To spend more time on your hobbies? To spend more time with your loved ones?

Whatever it is, it's your reason.

Write it down and stick it where you'll see it.

It doesn't have to be wordy. You can put 5 words on a post-it note and stick it to your computer. You can stick on your bathroom mirror. You can hang it on your wall. You can put it on your iPhone lock screen.

Whatever it is, keep it in front of your face.

Coming up in the next email - Prepare to Win. It includes one includes an action-packed and tiny little book that'll help you free up time to build your new life… on the side.)

That'll hit your inbox on Tuesday. Until then....think about your F*ck This moment, and write it down!

Amy

## Email #2 - How to build your castle

Did you know that you’re building a castle, Brian?

This may come as a shock. You probably thought you were gonna make an ebook, or a tiny SaaS app, or a workshop, or a screencast series. Nope. Castle.

You’re building a strategic marvel that will help you first carve out — then defend — the life you want from the life you already have.

That’s the life-changing magic of part two on our little 3-part approach:

1. Committing
2. **Preparing to win**
3. Executing (over the long haul)

You’re about to learn exactly what plans you can make to ensure your success… but first, let’s talk castles. A specific castle.

Picture the soft green coast of northwest Wales. Five-sided towers in ivory stone rise directly from the shore to a height of nearly 100ft. This is Caenarfon Castle, the icon of English control. The year is 1404.

An army of boats lands on that shore — a Welsh army fortified with French troops. At command is the famed warlord, Owain Glyndŵr. His goal? Nothing short of revolution. To reclaim Wales for the Welsh.

Glyndŵr stormed the banks of his former land with passion… and reinforcements.

Inside the castle were just 28 men. To defend the enormous castle against an army — two armies!

Those are some pretty terrible odds... if the playing field were level. But it wasn’t. That tiny garrison was able to defend the enormous castle.

The small team won.

They didn’t win because they were righteous or passionate or courageous or lucky.

They won by design.

Master James of St. George deliberately set out to design and build a castle that could be defended by a skeleton crew against all but the largest and most modern siege engines.

He gave it walls 6 meters thick. He gave it hidden walkways — the men inside could move safely and secretly, their number hidden from the enemy. He threw away the classic round turret design and gave Caenarfon five-sided towers with innovative floor-to-ceiling arrow slits; a handful of archers could cover an enormous field, plucking off invaders while remaining invisible. He gave the gate two draw bridges, a series of multiple battery-resistant doors, and a minefield of murder holes and archer’s perches.

Caenarfon remained unconquered for 363 years.

**That’s what I call preparing to win.**

The 3 principles you need to **prepare to win** are:

- Offense and defense — to carve out your territory and protect it with an iron fist
- Efficiency — to design your process & product now so one person (you!) can have an outsized impact
- Effectiveness — to let go of pre-conceived notions that hold you back, do only what works

Over the next 3 emails, you’ll apply every single one of those to your life, your work, your Year of Hustle.

You’ll carve out time — and build defensive walls around it. You’ll learn how to choose the most efficient product, process, and business.

And lastly, you’ll learn which unconscious habits and unquestioned beliefs are undermining your success (and what to do about it).

Real castles aren’t fairy tales. Real castles work.

This year, your _Year of Hustle_, you’re going to build a real castle.

Amy

## Email #3 - Now carve out (& defend) your hustle time

Okay, Brian!

In my last email, I left you with the 3 principles you need to prepare to win:

- **Offense and defense**
- Efficiency
- Effectiveness

Today you’re going to get offensive and defensive of your most precious resource.

Today you’re going to carve out your castle’s future stronghold in the most disputed territory of all… your calendar.

Hold onto your butts cuz I’m about to hit you with a number.

Ninety-six.

You need 96 hours for your _Year of Hustle_, give or take a few:

- 35 hours (or less) on the product itself — as the roadmap says
- 61 hours to write your content marketing pieces, write your evergreen launch sequence, set up a squeeze page, and set up all your systems

If you’re yelping in pain, you can release your vise-like grip on your butt cheeks now. The worst part is over. You know the number. The big… scary… number.

Luckily, the Roadmap showed you exactly what we do to big scary numbers:

**Break 'em down into tiny little chunks (then crush ‘em).**

Remember the _12 weeks_ from the Roadmap?

Bam! Here are your crushable chunks:

```text
96 / 12          = 8 hours a week
8 hours / 7 days = 1 hour, 9 minutes a day
```

There we go… just over an hour a day. Is it a walk in the park with an ice cream cone and a shiny red ballon? Nope. We’re talking about the work that will overhaul your career and your life. To build your castle.

**It’s not effortless. It's worth the effort.**

An hour a day is the equivalent of taking a single, lightweight college class. That’s how little it takes to carve out and defend your future.

You can do it.

And I’m here to help you.

**There are two ways to slay your schedule.**

One, you can be the kind of intuitive person who just magically frees up time when they need it with nary a ball dropped. If you’re that kind of person, bravo! You’re going to succeed without breaking a sweat! I promise to only hate you a little.

Two… well, welcome to the club. We’re unintuitive but we try harder. I came up with a three-step strategy for myself and turned it into a little booklet for you.

Slay Your Schedule is 20 tight little pages with just one goal: Help you carve out your 8 hours a week. And yes, it’s free.

Go on the offense… download your copy of _Slay Your Schedule_.

It’s a helluva lot easier than carving and stacking a bunch of real, live sandstone blocks.

And stay tuned for my next email, cuz it's all about product ideas. Good ones, bad ones, where they come from, and why so many of them fail.

-Amy

## Email #4 - What's so tempting about failure?

So tell me… is failure tempting?

“Uh… no.”

But isn’t it, though, Brian?

People think failure is like a movie-star villain — ugly, and evil, and you know it. To the contrary, failure is a pretty little candle flame that sucks in moths and spits out roasted moth-snacks.

Failure is all teeth, an angler fish lurking in the dark behind its shiny little lure.

Failure is a big, beautiful stained glass window in the sides of your castle’s defensive walls.

Failure is the moment you feel the heavens part and the light shine down, because you just came up with your BIG IDEA.

Failure is a light.

Or a lightbulb.

**Most failure is predictable.**

You’ve seen this at work in your career — if the boss won’t deal with the problem employee, if the stakeholder won’t stop with the endless revisions, if the developer refuses to write tests, if the designer won’t read a book on interface design, if the sales people won’t talk to the creative team and the creative team won’t talk to customers, well, the project is doomed. Maybe not today, but soon.

People like to talk about failure as if it were a total surprise — a bolt from the blue. But that’s a CYA (Cover Your Ass) strategy.

If they were honest, they'd have to admit it’s their fault, they saw it coming… and didn’t stop it.

Now, most of the predictable fail above is caused by Other People. And, obv, you're doing your Year of Hustle by yourself.

But being alone doesn’t make you safe.

**There are shiny pretty failure traps all around you.**

The more alluring they are, the more easily they will suck you in and destroy you.

That’s why the biggest section of the Year of Hustle Roadmap deals so explicitly with the **four most dangerous parts** of the process:

1. Data
2. Insight
3. Methods
4. Product (Design)

**You may find yourself tempted to skip or change the steps.**

This would be a mistake.

We’ve already received a few emails from folks who proudly tell us that they’re going to violate the basic rules and hope it works out, somehow, anyway. Flicker, flicker pretty little flame.

Here’s the thing:

I painstakingly designed these steps after 16 years in business, and 8 years running a product biz, and 6 years teaching creative pros like you how to create a product biz.

I have seen every type of failure under the sun.

**98% of failures happen up front. 98% are totally avoidable.**

The Roadmap _will_ route you around all 7 of the worst failure traps:

1. Not STARTING
2. Not CONTINUING
3. Creating a product NOBODY wants
4. Dooming yourself with a HUGE project you’ll never FINISH
5. Not MARKETING before, during, & after
6. GIVING UP after one small success
7. Relying on a “ONE AND DONE" event for launch

Yep. That’s where most products die. And you'll very smartly avoid all these deadly mistakes, if you actually follow the Roadmap.

If you pull off the highway and go tramping over a barrier into the no man’s land, you’re gonna find yourself neck-deep in quicksand.

There’s a reason castles have walls and towers and turrets and moats and not candy floss and rainbow bridges and pillow forts. That’d be adorable, but it sure as hell wouldn’t be defensible. And castles are made for defense… and offense.

There's a reason you don’t build your castle on quicksand.

**Remember, the 3 principles you need to prepare to win are:**

1. Offense and defense — to carve out your territory and protect it with an iron fist
2. Efficiency — to design your process & product now so one person (you!) can have an outsized impact
3. Effectiveness — to let go of pre-conceived notions that hold you back, do only what works

These aren’t just traits of your castle itself, they’re principles you need to apply to yourself.

**OFFENSE**: There’s stuff you need to complete your Hustle — data, time, resources, energy. Go get it!

**DEFENSE**: Now that you’ve got it, protect it. Build a wall around your resources to keep them safe!

**EFFICIENCY**: Tackle your weekly tasks with the seriousness they deserve. Get ‘em done and move on. Take the direct route.

**EFFECTIVENESS**: _Do things that work._

That last one is a real killer. You can be offensive, defensive, and efficient… but if you aren’t doing things that work, you’ll be safely and efficiently getting absolutely nowhere at all. You can feel like you’re making progress. It may look like you’re getting somewhere. But like quicksand, every movement takes you deeper and deeper.

Moths navigate by the moon; artificial lights confuse their senses and lure them to their death. The candle flame “feels” right, but it’s wrong.

Skipping steps in the Roadmap to “do it your way” feels right… but is it effective?

**After inaction, ineffectiveness is the biggest cause of failure.**

Don’t be tempted off the path by shiny, pretty failure traps. Don’t repeat past mistakes or indulge bad habits.

Take expert advice. Do the work. Do what works.

**Follow the Roadmap.**

-Amy

## Email #5 - How to create a product that sells

I always tell my students: Starting a business is picking a fight with entropy. It’s not competition or “the market" that’ll kill you… it’s the tendency for things to descend into disorder, chaos and inaction.

Remember way back at the verrrrry beginning of this lil Hustle course, I told you there were 3 parts to success?

1. Committing
1. Preparing to win
1. Executing (over the long haul)

This is designed to prepare you for your battle with entropy, your Year of Hustle. Those first two steps helped you create your own offensive and defensive plan:

- Commitment? Check.
- Time? Check.
- Guards against failure? Check.
- Winner’s mindset? Check!

Congrats, you’ve successfully armed yourself and girded your loins for creative battle!

**Now it’s time to take ACTION! It’s time to execute.**

Your next two lessons are all about product design and marketing. Cuz shit’s about to get real.

**Let’s talk about product design first.**

Let’s walk through the biggest, baddest, and most insanely valuable part of the Year of Hustle Roadmap. Open up your PDF copy to follow along. Ready? Kick ass.

Whether it’s written, spoken, coded, recorded, given live as a workshop… all products are designed. Even if you’d never in a million years call yourself a “designer.”

**You have to decide:**

- what to make
- what to include
- how it works for the customer
- how it’s put together

Not by divine inspiration, not by accident, but by informed decision.

Remember: You’re not trying to ship a work of art or The World’s Most Innovative Widget. You’re trying to ship and sell a product. You’re here to launch a business.

**That means you need to respect sales math:**

> offer + happy customer = product

That's the bottom line: No customer, no sale, no biz. You can build the most amazing widget ever, but if nobody wants to buy it? It’s not a product, it’s a toy.

The customer is the one absolutely crucial factor that most “bright ideas” leave out. Oops.

BUT, when you **start with the customer** — if, from the very first day, you design what they need and have paid for in the past — then you can almost guarantee your eventual success.

This bears repeating:

**Start with the customer, and you are practically fail-proof.**

The customer makes your choices.

Because when you relentlessly focus on helping your customer, you naturally avoid all the failure traps that get between you and them. Perfectionism, waffling, scope creep, unnecessary ornamentation… **none** of those serve to help your customer.

Your customer is the perfect motivator.

**That’s why the Roadmap starts with you gathering raw DATA** about your future customers. At heart, all the questions in DATA boil down into three categories:

- What do they need?
- What do they want?
- What do they buy?

That knowledge? That’s marketing gold. And then, when you follow the Year of Hustle process, it leads you straight to where you fit in (INSIGHT) and how you can help kill their pain (METHOD).

```text
    audience

need  want  buy
```

**Then — and only then! — do you actually start designing _the product itself_.**

Because what we call “The Product” is really just the packaging.

All the best products attack a problem. Every problem can be attacked in a multitude of ways, from a multitude of angles. The Year of Hustle shows you how to pick your one way, your one angle.

The format of it? That’s packaging.

Example: If your audience has a skill gap, you can help them out and…

- do it for them (service)
- teach them how (book, videos)
- guide them through it (workshop, coaching)
- give them a map (checklists, white papers, case studies, interviews)
- outfit them with a head start (libraries, samples, templates, themes)
- automate the method (with a tool or sequence or even a tiny app)

The possibilities are endless.

And once you ship and make sales with a product in one format? You can always revisit the method by packaging it in another format! Some customers will want hand-holding. Some will want tools. Some will want nothing more than to be pointed in the right direction. You can, in time, use the same pain and same method to reach them all.

**That’s the stuff empires are made of.**

That’s why you start with the customer first — their pains, their needs, their wants.

That’s why you should follow the Roadmap to the letter!

Keep to the constraints:

- Limit yourself to one pain.
- Limit yourself to one angle, one method.
- Limit yourself to 10-15 hours saved for your customer.
- Limit yourself to 35 hours to build your **first** product.

The Roadmap is designed to help you get your first product out there, making sales in the most efficient and effective way possible.

Sales creates customers. Customers create more customers. The more you sell, the easier it’ll be to sell more. Once you’ve got the experience of designing, building, shipping, launching, marketing, and selling a tiny product? You’ll be able to apply those skills to a bigger product… if you want.

Our 30x500 alum **Rob** used the advanced version of this process to investigate one of his professional audiences — freelancers:

```text
Rob's audience: freelance designers and devs

- what hurts?
  - "Making money is "feast or famine"
  - "what are the best job boards for freelancers?"
  - "How do you find quality freelance leads?"
- what do they buy?
  - Exposure: Dribbble Pro
  - Outsourcing: virtual assistant, finders fees
  - Directories: freelance.com, odesk
- what do they want?
  - more billable hours (less time spent hunting for work)
  - clients who know what they want
```

You can see how even this small amount of raw DATA could be used to launch an _huge_ product.

But, Rob was smarter than that. He chose just **one** method of attack, and **one** package — to begin with. His first offering, Workshop, is a paid leads service. It was quick to spin up, easy to sell, and not very expensive.

Workshop alone has made enough money for him to be able to reshape his life.

Now Rob is branching out into other products and services like this book, thanks to…

1. what he learned, and
2. the customer base he already built with Workshop

That’s how epic success is built: Not with one huge launch that changes everything, forever… but one tiny brick of success after another.

So, when you sit down to work on your Year of Hustle, keep the most important thing in mind: **Your customer**.

Don’t straightjacket yourself with perfectionism. Don’t let the scope expand to the size of the universe. Don’t imagine that you have to revolutionize anything.

Help **your customer** solve a problem. Save them 10-15 hours of work time or money. Finish it. Ship it. Launch it.

Make your first sales as soon as you possibly can.

**Follow the Roadmap.**

And stay tuned, because our next email will show you exactly how to create content marketing that actually helps make sales. We’re going to send you a free package of 4 complete video lessons and exercises straight from our class, 30x500. For free.

That’s the class Rob took to create Workshop (and it’s created millions of dollars of revenue for other students!).

Until then....

## Email #6 - Learn the killer method to market anything

Are you excited to market your pants off, Brian?!

> “Uh… no?"

Yeah, yeah, I already used this opening for another email… the one about failure :) And I’m using it again today because if there’s one thing us creative pros believe, it’s that:

**Good work speaks for itself.**

Which, on the face of it, sounds really reasonable: Quality **is** an unmistakeable experience.

But… that means that people can’t tell if a thing is quality **until they experience it**.

Which means you have to bring the people in first.

**Which means you have to market early and often.**

Marketing is so crucial to the success of every product — no matter how beautiful and perfect — that it occupies two spots in the 7 Failure Traps:

\#5 - Not MARKETING before, during, & after  
\#7 - Relying on a “ONE AND DONE" event for launch

Many creative professionals (like you!) fail at marketing because of…

- the mindset that “good work speaks for itself"
- the belief that “marketing” is manipulative, scammy, self-serving, or just plain rude
- the related belief that “good marketing” is mainly telling people “Hey my product is available”
- a mistaken focus on ads, promotions, etc.

But those are all based on a complete misunderstanding of what marketing does!

**_Great marketing helps people._** Full stop.

Our Roadmap shows you how (and why) to create a product that helps people. If a product helps people, they’ll gladly pay for it. And they’ll share it.

And the same logic applies to the marketing for the product:

1. If marketing helps people, they’ll share it.
2. And when it gives them results, they’ll trust you.
3. And then they’ll like you.
4. And then they’ll want to buy.
5. And then your product will help them.
6. And then they’ll share that.

**That’s the power of an efficient and effective marketing approach.**

You can’t buy that kind of trust, rapport, and respect. But you can build it.

The Roadmap specifies 5-10 content marketing pieces. You’ll use those to build traffic, rapport, trust, and to help your customers. So they become customers.

**How will _you_ do it?**

Well, I couldn’t fit an entire content marketing guide into the Roadmap itself. (It's already so HUGE!)

But! Because you signed up to change your life this year, to make this year your Year of Hustle, I’ve got a special present to help you kick ass on the way:

- 5 complete lessons direct from our class, 30x500 Academy
- plus **1 three-part exercise** to get you on your way

You’ll learn how to design the virtuous cycle to build traffic, rapport, trust, and sales. You’ll learn the most effective kind of content marketing you can — and you’ll kiss writer’s block goodbye, because you’ll also learn how to come up with infinite topics that your audience will love.

## Email #7 - Amy's year of hustle story

Lemme tell you a little story, Brian

**The Year of Hustle started as a challenge I set _myself_.**

March 2008. That was the moment when I decided to start a product business. I spent a month in New Zealand, and for the first time ever, I was far enough away from my consulting work… to realize how much I hated it.

_April through June_, I watched, listened, and noted the pains in my peer group (design and dev consulting agencies).

_July_, I analyzed workflows in the popular app people loved to hate. And sketched out the flow that would become Freckle’s Quick Entry and Quick Reporting feature.

_September, October, November_ — my husband and I built the very first barebones version of Freckle on about a day a week.

_December_ — we launched!

_January 2009_, we ran our first billing cycle: about $1,500 for the month.

Over the next year, we grew Freckle to almost $30,000 ARR — a respectable first year, but nothing like enough to live on.

**December 2010 rolled around… I was still consulting.**

And we’d just finally shipped a client project that felt like a full-body beating.

I drew a line in the sand: NO MORE CONSULTING.

We couldn’t live off Freckle. I didn’t have another option lined up. But for me, there was no going back.

I burned that bridge and set fire to the boats.

**The only way to survive? Hustle my ass off.**

So we completed our JavaScript performance book. We amped up our JS workshops and productized them as much as we could. And I shipped the very first proto-class that would later become 30x500.

That was 9 years ago.

Today, our product biz brings in over a million dollars in revenue a year. And most of that is Freckle!

**But the lesson for you, as you embark on your Year of Hustle, is that this shit takes time. It takes time, and it takes effort.**

There will always be false starts. There will always be sticking points.

I tell my students:

Business is one of those things that feels like it doesn't work, doesn't work, doesn't work, until one beautiful moment it all CLICKS! and it works from there on out.

But if you aren't grinding, grinding, grinding away at it for a while, though, it'll never yield. You'll never get to that beautiful perfect CLICK! You'll always be stuck on the side where it sucks.

We're here to help you make sure you're grinding in the right direction, but we can't teleport you to the future. The future is coming whether you want it or not.

The only question is: Will it be the future you want?

**Then you need to start now. Don't wait.**

If you're thinking, "OK, but I can't start working on this til next month, I have these huge projects going on right now!" — then believe me, as someone who’s always got too many balls in the air, I hear ya.

If you really want it, don't wait.

**Start small. Be consistent. Stack the Bricks.**
