### Insight

A view into your customer's world: what hurts or helps _one (juicy) pain_ that wastes their time/money/stress?

### Data

Questions and Answers that lead you straight to the customer's pain (and value)

## 3. How do you get it... fast? and _without_ fail?

> Get the most out of the gold you've already got!

### 1. Answer these questions to gather your raw data

**(Write answers with pen and paper!)**

- What do your future customers need?
- What is **one thing** people in your industry...
  - need to know?
  - fail to do?
  - waste time on?
  - always eff up?
  - bitch about?
  - don't understand?
  - don't have time for?
  - love achieving?
  - feel great about?
  - consider "successful"?
- What's one thing that makes them...
  - lose money?
  - more money?

> Pro Tip: You don't need to be a "visionary"... just identify problems and help people

### 2. Figure out where your customer's world intersects yours

Their pain + your sills = âœ¨ðŸ’°

- Pain: where do they suck?
- You: where could you slide in?
- Win: what could they win?

#### The insight process

1. Take all the raw data you gathered (above)
2. Divide it into _pains_ (fails) and _wins_ (positive outcomes)
3. Fill out this madlib for as many of the _pains_/_wins_ as you can:
   - People in my industry suck at `_______`, but if only theyâ€™d `_______`, like me theyâ€™d have `_______`
4. Youâ€™ll generate a LOT of these insights, but pick _JUST ONE PAIN_ to tackle!

> Pro Tip: Your goal is $10k... Not a revolution (And you don't have to be an expert to help someone, just better than they are!)

### 3. Choose a single approach to reducing or eliminating one pain

- How will you help them kill that pain?

```text
            MINDSET : They think productively about their work/industry
    KNOWLEDGE/FACTS : They have all the pure facts and knowledge they require
SKILL/ABILITY LEVEL : They have the skills they require AND are good at them
     IMPLEMENTATION : They easily apply the skills they have to real-world projects
          EXECUTION : They easily start, persist, and finish those projects
            PROCESS : They follow a step-by-step process for reproducible success
           TEMPLATE : They have the code, design elements, writing, etc. they need
               TOOL : They have the tools they need to execute quickly and accurately
```

#### The Method Process

1. Take the _ONE PAIN_ you chose.
2. Read each of the above method statements above, aloud.
3. Make a note every time one is a blatant lie! Like so:
   1. **"They have all the skills they need - AND! - are good at them...?"** Ha! They couldn't `_______` if their lives depended on it. Sure, they can `_______`, but they're still newbies
4. Of the methods you wrote down, pick the _ONE_ you feel most comfy producing.

> REMEMBER: You goal is to save them 10 hours of work or money, not totally make over their life

### 4. Design a small, sharp delivery mechanism for the method

- How will you package the method?
  - Screencast
  - Webinar
  - Mini workshop
  - Audio lessons
  - Parts library
  - Themes
  - Plugin
  - Tool
  - Scripts
  - Checklists
  - Workbook
  - Mini book
  - Single feature app

#### The Product Process

1. Inventory your skills: What comest _EASIEST_ to you? Fastest? Best?
2. Inventory your byproducts: What _GOOD STUFF_ (code/design/words/slides/spreadsheets/processes/template) have you already made for your work?
3. How can you deliver on **THE METHOD** in _ONE_ work week, or 35 hours?
4. **OUTLINE** your simple product: What skills will you teach? What chapters, videos, etc. will that require? What is the one feature your toll will offer? What other things are required to ship? How will you charge? What will the interface be?
5. Cut ruthlessly. And then cut it down some more.

**DON'T OVERDO IT. KEEP IT SMALL AND SHARP. Your goal: save them 10-15 hours of work or money**

> DO NOT - REPEAT - DO NOT GET CARRIED AWAY WITH YOUR PRODUCT SCOPE
> This is not your _magnum opus_: more product die than are ever born

## 4. Execute!

- **Design, build, launch, ship... in 12 weeks**
  - Break it down into chunks and hustle your buns off!
