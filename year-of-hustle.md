## 3. How do you get it... fast? and _without_ fail?

> Get the most out of the gold you've already got!

### 1. Answer these questions to gather your raw data

**(Write answers with pen and paper!)**

- What do your future customers need?
- What is **one thing** people in your industry...
  - need to know?
  - fail to do?
  - waste time on?
  - always eff up?
  - bitch about?
  - don't understand?
  - don't have time for?
  - love achieving?
  - feel great about?
  - consider "successful"?
- What's one thing that makes them...
  - lose money?
  - more money?

> Pro Tip: You don't need to be a "visionary"... just identify problems and help people

### 2. Figure out where your customer's world intersects yours

Their pain + your sills = âœ¨ðŸ’°

- Pain: where do they suck?
- You: where could you slide in?
- Win: what could they win?

#### The insight process

1. Take all the raw data you gathered (above)
2. Divide it into _pains_ (fails) and _wins_ (positive outcomes)
3. Fill out this madlib for as many of the _pains_/_wins_ as you can:
   - People in my industry suck at `_______`, but if only theyâ€™d `_______`, like me theyâ€™d have `_______`
4. Youâ€™ll generate a LOT of these insights, but pick _JUST ONE PAIN_ to tackle!

> Pro Tip: Your goal is $10k... Not a revolution (And you don't have to be an expert to help someone, just better than they are!)

### 3. Choose a single approach to reducing or eliminating one pain
