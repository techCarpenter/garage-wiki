## The Mom Test:

1. Talk about their life instead of your idea
2. Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future
3. Talk less and listen more

## Getting back on track (avoiding bad data):

- Deflect compliments
- Anchor fluff
- Dig beneath opinions, ideas, requests, and emotions

## Mistakes and symptoms:

1. **Fishing for compliments.**
   - "I’m thinking of starting a business... so, do you think it will work?"
   - "I had an awesome idea for an app — do you like it?"
2. **Exposing your ego (aka The Pathos Problem).**
   - "So here’s that top-secret project I quit my job for... what do you think?"
   - "I can take it — be honest and tell me what you really think!"
3. **Being pitchy.**
   - "No no, I don’t think you get it..."
   - "Yes, but it also does this!"
4. **Being too formal.**
   - "So, first off, thanks for agreeing to this interview. I just have a few questions for you and then I’ll let you get back to your day…"
   - "On a scale of 1 to 5, how much would you say you…"
   - "Let’s set up a meeting."
5. **Being a learning bottleneck.**
   - "You just worry about the product. I’ll handle the customers."
   - "Because the customers told me so!"
   - "I don’t have time to talk to people — I need to get back to coding!"
6. **Collecting compliments instead of facts and commitments.**
   - "We’re getting a lot of positive feedback."
   - "Everybody I’ve talked to loves the idea."

## The process around the meeting:

### Before

- If you haven’t yet, choose a focused, findable segment
- With your team, decide your big 3 learning goals
- If relevant, decide on ideal next steps and commitments
- If conversations are the right tool, figure out who to talk to
- Create a series of your best guesses about what the person cares about
- If a question could be answered via desk research, do that first

### During

- Frame the conversation
- Keep it casual
- Ask good questions which pass The Mom Test
- Deflect compliments, anchor fluff, and dig beneath signals
- Take good notes
- If relevant, press for commitment and next steps

### After

- With your team, review your notes and key customer quotes
- If relevant, transfer notes into permanent storage
- Update your beliefs and plans
- Decide on the next 3 big questions

## Results of a good meeting:

- Facts — concrete, specific facts about what they do and why they do it (as opposed to the bad data of compliments, fluff, and opinions)
- Commitment — They are showing they’re serious by giving up something they value such as meaningful amounts of time, reputation risk, or money
- Advancement — They are moving to the next step of your real-world funnel and getting closer to a sale

## Signs you’re just going through the motions:

- You’re talking more than they are
- They are complimenting you or your idea
- You told them about your idea and don’t have next steps
- You don’t have notes
- You haven’t looked through your notes with your team
- You got an unexpected answer and it didn’t change your idea
- You weren’t scared of any of the questions you asked
- You aren’t sure which big question you’re trying to answer
- You aren’t sure why you’re having the meeting

## Writing it down — signal symbols:

| Symbol | Meaning                                                   |
| :----: | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
|   :)   | Excited                                                   |
|   :(   | Angry                                                     |
|  :\|   | Embarrassed                                               |
|   ☇    | Pain or problem (symbol is a lightning bolt)              |

|   ⤴    | Workaround                                                |

|   ☆    | Follow-up task                                            |

## Signs you aren’t pushing for commitment and advancement:

- A pipeline of zombie leads
- Ending product meetings with a compliment
- Ending product meetings with no clear next steps
- Meetings which "went well"
- They haven’t given up anything of value

## Asking for and framing the meeting:

- Vision — half-sentence of how you’re making the world better
- Framing — where you’re at and what you’re looking for
- Weakness — where you’re stuck and how you can be helped
- Pedestal — show that they, in particular, can provide that help
- Ask — ask for help

## The big prep question:

- > "What do we want to learn from these guys?"
