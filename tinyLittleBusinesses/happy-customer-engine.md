# Build a happy customer creating engine with paid traffic

> "Knowing what I know, what would I do if I woke up tomorrow owning your business?" -Shawn

## Introduction

- What is paid traffic?
  - i.e. Google Ads, Bing, Facebook Ads, LinkedIn Ads
  - The exchange of money is _critical_
  - There is no "free traffic" - we pay for awareness with money and/or time.
- `traffic engine` - The system for consistently, reliably, and predictably creating and growing awareness, interest, and desire for a business.
- Why should you care?

## Day 1: Will it Make the Boat Go Faster?

Building a business online is **HARD**.

There are limitless options for business models, strategies, tools, tactics, and platforms

> "Will it make the boat go faster?"

- What is the 'boat' we're working on?
- How do we clearly define 'faster'?

Define the 'boat' as our business / craft / profession.

### Assignment 1: define the boundaries of my business _on paper_.

- What are you paid for/what do you sell? (Product or service, physical or digital)
  - What is the thing customers buy from me?
- Where / how do your customers find you? (Organic traffic, paid traffic, word of mouth, referrals, affiliates, guest blogs, other online content, etc.)
- What measurable steps happen between awareness and purchase?
  - What do your prospects see, hear, and do that makes them aware that you / your business exists?
  - How do they begin to engage?
  - How to they continue to engage?
  - How do they eventually buy?

## Day 2: Three types of traffic [framework before work] — the first traffic pyramid

Framework: a way of understanding the world.

```
*1 & 2 - Active Intent
 3 - Passive Potential Interest

          / \
         / 1 \  - You
        /_____\
       /       \
      /    2    \  - What you have to offer
     /___________\
    /             \
   /       3       \  - If they knew you or what you
  /_________________\   offer exists, might be interested
```

1. There are **people searching for you**
   - Person, something you created, or a business
   - Lowest volume, highest quality traffic
2. There are **people searching for what you have to offer**
   - Search isn't specific to you, but you provide a solution that matches their search
   - High quality, high volume traffic
   - Very competitive (a good thing. competition means money to be made)
3. There are **people who, if they knew you or what you have to offer exists, _might_ be interested**
   - Highest volume, lowest quality

Biggest distinction is _search intent_.

- 1 & 2: Active intent
  - `roofing contractor near me` - solution-focused search
  - `how to fix a leaky roof` - problem-focused search
- 3: they're not looking
  - they might have interest if they find out about you

### Assignment 2: Identify how you're currently getting traffic in each of these three categories

- _Category 1_:
- _Category 2_:
- _Category 3_:

## Day 3: Just say no to “media buying” [traffic is part of the funnel]

## Day 4: Quality, then quantity [at first, do less, better — “scaling” is not the answer]

## Day 5: Ads should provide standalone value — especially facebook

## Day 6: Know your numbers

## Day 7: The traffic funnel [the second pyramid]

## Day 8: Work backwards

## Day 9: Leverage your strengths / match your content

## Day 10: Give the platforms what they want
