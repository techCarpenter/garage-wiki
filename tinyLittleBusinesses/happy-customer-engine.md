## Introduction

- What is paid traffic?
  - i.e. Google Ads, Bing, Facebook Ads, LinkedIn Ads
  - The exchange of money is _critical_
  - There is no "free traffic" - we pay for awareness with money and/or time.
- `traffic engine` - The system for consistently, reliably, and predictably creating and growing awareness, interest, and desire for a business.
- Why should you care?

## Day 1: Will it Make the Boat Go Faster?

Building a business online is **HARD**.

There are limitless options for business models, strategies, tools, tactics, and platforms

> "Will it make the boat go faster?"

- What is the 'boat' we're working on?
- How do we clearly define 'faster'?

Define the 'boat' as our business / craft / profession.

### Assignment 1: define the boundaries of my business _on paper_.

- What are you paid for/what do you sell? (Product or service, physical or digital)
  - What is the thing customers buy from me?
- Where / how do your customers find you? (Organic traffic, paid traffic, word of mouth, referrals, affiliates, guest blogs, other online content, etc.)
- What measurable steps happen between awareness and purchase?
  - What do your prospects see, hear, and do that makes them aware that you / your business exists?
  - How do they begin to engage?
  - How to they continue to engage?
  - How do they eventually buy?

## Day 2: Three types of traffic [framework before work] — the first traffic pyramid

Framework: a way of understanding the world.

```
*1 & 2 - Active Intent
 3 - Passive Potential Interest

          / \
         / 1 \  - You
        /_____\
       /       \
      /    2    \  - What you have to offer
     /___________\
    /             \
   /       3       \  - If they knew you or what you
  /_________________\   offer exists, might be interested
```

1. There are **people searching for you**
   - Person, something you created, or a business
   - Lowest volume, highest quality traffic
2. There are **people searching for what you have to offer**
   - Search isn't specific to you, but you provide a solution that matches their search
   - High quality, high volume traffic
   - Very competitive (a good thing. competition means money to be made)
3. There are **people who, if they knew you or what you have to offer exists, _might_ be interested**
   - Highest volume, lowest quality

Biggest distinction is _search intent_.

- 1 & 2: Active intent
  - `roofing contractor near me` - solution-focused search
  - `how to fix a leaky roof` - problem-focused search
- 3: they're not looking
  - they might have interest if they find out about you

### Assignment 2: Identify how you're currently getting traffic in each of these three categories

- _Category 1_:
- _Category 2_:
- _Category 3_:

## Day 3: Just say no to “media buying” [traffic is part of the funnel]

The days of cheap traffic are long gone and are never coming back!

**Make traffic part of the funnel**, not an _afterthought_

Incorporate the source and intent of your prospects as integral parts of your offers/funnels.

### Assignment 3: Pick one offer you're running or planning to run and make three lists.

1. List 1: All the reasons someone might benefit from your offer.
   - Be **very specific**, ask and asnwer "_why_" several times for every item.
   - Write out each answer.
   - Mark the top 5-7
2. List 2: All the reasons why someone **might not want to engage with your offer**.
   - **\*** not your product/service, the offer itself
3. List 3: All the ways someone could sabatoage/undermine the value your product/service provides.

## Day 4: Quality, then quantity [at first, do less, better — “scaling” is not the answer]

Focus on critical few factors responsible for manjority of results

- active intent vs. passive _potential_ interest
- quality vs. quantity

Paid search approach:

- Identify **one** very specific keyword phrase that's perfect for you business
- Write **one** really great ad that speaks to someone who wants _exactly what you are offering_. Speak to his/her needs.

Do one thing exceptionally well and celebrate that success before moving on to the next thing.

## Day 5: Ads should provide standalone value — especially facebook

Objective: write a long-form Facebook ad (650-1000 words)

1. Requires:
   - a deep dive into the value you can offer
   - an understanding of who will benefit most from that value
   - ...and who won't benefit
2. long-form ads force you to think of the ad as part of the offer funnel
   - cohesion/congruence in your messaging
3. **long-form ads pre-quality prospects**, increasing quality of visitors
4. long-form ads can be repurposed

What to avoid:

1. Avoid making a promise with a time frame.
   - i.e. create a 6-figure biz in three months
2. Avoid the words _you_ and _your_ in ad copy.

Tone is important. **Good ads need to feel like they’re social first**.

- The first two lines of the ad will dramatically affect performance.
  - Start by asking a question

_Before you begin, grab the 3 lists from lesson three_

Choose the benefit that is most important to your prospects from the 5-7 benefits list.

**What _gain_ does that provide and/or _problem_ does that solve**?

The question is an opportunity to connect with your ideal prospect.

Ask a powerful question that is deeply important to them.

Pretend you're talking with someone else who is interested while sitting on an airplane.

- Command respect, don't demand it
- Share the 3-5 most important things you would want to know
- Explain why this offer might not be a good fit
- Be very clear about what they will need to do when they take action
  - opt-in with email address
  - watch a webinar
  - etc.
  - By being clear up front, people who aren't interested won't click through!

To wrap up:

1. Ask a powerful question that is deeply important to your ideal prospect.
2. Quickly (and with appropriate humility) explain your experience and expertise relative to that question.
3. Share your top 3-5 insights without getting deep in the weeds. Remember the person you’re talking to doesn’t know what you know, so use clear, conversational language.
4. Then, be honest about any factors that would disqualify someone from benefiting from whatever you have to offer.
5. Finally, tell them what to do next and what will be involved. Don’t justify or sugarcoat anything — if someone needs to watch a 90-minute webinar to understand your offer, tell them that.

## Day 6: Know your numbers

Business management metrics vs. Account management metrics

We only need three numbers to manage an online business intelligently:

1. CPA (Cost per acquisition)
2. AOV (Average order value)
3. LTV (Lifetime value)

The framework:

- How much do you spend to create awareness of your business?
- How many customers / clients do you get in that same time frame?
- How much does each customer / client spend initially?
- On average, how much does a customer / client spend over the course of a year or more (whatever is appropriate to your business)?

**The goal is to provide so much value that your AOV and LTV are so high that CPA becomes effectively irrelevant**

## Day 7: The traffic funnel [the second pyramid]

```
The traffic funnel
___________________
\                 /
 \       1       /  - Awareness
  \_____________/
   \           /
    \    2    /  - Engagement
     \_______/
      \     /
       \ 3 /  - Conversion
        \ /
```

The traffic funnel shows the **intent of our marketing efforts**

1. Awareness is the point of initial contact. The transition from unknown to known.
2. Engagement is when we want the prospect to do something to take a step toward us.
   - comment, opt-in, attend a webinar, etc.
3. Conversion is when we're **focused on making the sale**

Awareness: top of the funnel. Share content that demonstrates authority (and empathy). Video and text both work.

Engagement: middle of the funnel. **This is overwhelmingly lead generation**. Most paid traffic campaigns start with the middle of the funnel.

Typical middle funnel campaign is a big, specific promise fulfilled by:

- a lead magnet
- a multi-day series of emails

## Day 8: Work backwards

> Begin with the end in mind.

Map your buyer's journey (step by step) and then work backwards from the conversion point.

- What is she thinking at this point?
- What are her concerns?
- Potential objections?
- What could you offer to reinforce your credibility and demonstrate your empathy?
- How could you make her decision to move forward easier?

## Day 9: Leverage your strengths / match your content

When deciding what medium to post ads with, do what you do best (i.e. text vs. video)

1. Take 10 minutes and write an email to a friend explaining an offer you’re making or an offer you’re considering.
2. Now, the same experiment, except this time you need to use a phone or Skype/Zoom.

Really figure out if you prefer writing, video/audio, or both:

- Did you talk your way into your first job?
- Write love letters to attract your spouse?
- Are you the person people call on to give a great speech or tell a great joke?
- Does the thought of being on stage light you up (or make you want to run and hide)?
- Do you journal? How do you understand what you’re thinking (talking out loud with a friend or writing to expose your thoughts)?

## Day 10: Give the platforms what they want

- Google: match questions to relevant answers.
- Facebook: think edutainment

Ask: _"how likely is it that someone will want to share this ad?"_

Assignment:

1. Identify 2-3 questions you're well qualified to answer (professionally)
   1. What are 2-3 perfect questions you wished prospects would ask you?
2. Take the ad you wrote on day five
   1. Is it interesting to read? Conversational?
   2. Have you clearly articulated a few insights that aren't common, conventional wisdom for people interested in your expertise?
   3. Is your ad intriguing - does it capture the reader's interest?
   4. Is it authentic?
   5. Is there an "ah ha" moment in it where the reader is shown a different perspective?
