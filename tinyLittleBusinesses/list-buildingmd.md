# Unconventional approach to list building

[Article]([https://link](https://tinylittlebusinesses.com/list-building/))

Spoiler: A bigger list isn't always better...

## Marketing framework

1. Targeted POP (pocket of people)

2. Filter out the people who you **don't** want to do business with (BEFORE you get them on your list!)...
3. Then get the best people onto your email list (in a way that pulls them toward you - usually rules out "bribes" and lead magnets)...
4. Email follow-up sequence
5. Offer. (Only after you've established trust and attention.)

Instead of trying to get the most number of people onto your list, pre-qualify people so only the best people end up on your list.

1. Strategy of Preeminence (SoP)
   > An attitude where you look at everybody out there that you want to do business with, and that you make it a point of deciding you’re **not going to wait for money to change hands before** you start contributing, guiding, counseling, advising, and protecting them. When this is your default way of doing business, you establish yourself from the very beginning **as the only viable solution** — to a problem, a challenge, an issue, or an opportunity in their life.
2. An understanding that business (how you create, deliver, and capture value) is a complex system.

**Prefer email lists that are ultra-targeted and hyper-responsive**

## Typical "status quo" guru email list method

There's a short squeeze page.

There's a bribe in the form of lead magnet in exchange for an email address.

What happens next:

- There's an offer
- There's no real DESIRE to be on their email list other than getting access to the offer
- Sign up with a bogus email or unsubscribe...

## Unconventional email list method

There's a story. It connects with hearts and minds and influences through empathy, not persuasion through coercion.

Ends with a barrier-to-entry - a little _hoop_ to jump through - in the form of an opt-in form. Framed as an opportunity to hear more. To hear more of the story and get more high-value content.

Prospects no longer feel bribed for their email! (Very different value exchange)

**They now want to be on our email list**

## Squeeze

<start example>

You (that’s YOU!) have a desperate problem you’re trying to solve (insert emotional
problem here).

You go to Google and you type in a number of search queries in an attempt to uncover a
potential solution to your problem.

You spend ages clicking on results (paid and free). But all you find are badly written
articles surrounded by blocks of ads. Or you find forced squeeze pages like I’ve already
mentioned above.

You bite the bullet and signup for one. The lead magnet ends up being nothing more than a
video sales letter.

Unfazed, you move on.

No way you’re going to buy from that person.

Next you land on a video lead capture page. But you can’t watch the video until you
opt-in. Seriously?

Brilliant.

So this time you enter in a bogus email address.

The 45 minute “free presentation” turns out to be nothing more than a low-value sales
pitch for a $197 magic pill solution.

You’re getting despondent (and angry) now.

Everyone seems so quick to sell their solution to you. But you don’t know, like, or trust
any of them (not yet anyway). Not one has even attempted to understand you a little more
deeply.

No empathy.

No rapport.

No relationship.

No jack shit.

You do one last search.

You land on a website.

It’s completely different from all the rest.

It’s full of (amazing) content.

You read it.

It seems to pull you along. It explains a quick method you can use to relieve some of the
emotional pain you’re experiencing. You don’t even need to try this technique to know
that it’ll work.

You already feel as though you’re moving closer to solving your problem.

The author knows his stuff. That’s crystal clear. He gets you, understands you. No
question about that. He uses words and language that mean something to you. You can feel
a connection. This person clearly empathizes with your unique issue.

The content finally ends.

But you want more of it.

You don’t want this experience to end.

For the first time you feel you’re closer to finding a solution than you’ve ever been
before. You’re not forced to opt-in.

There’s no bribe.

This time the dynamics have somehow changed. Because you WANT to opt-in for more. You’re
excited. So you eagerly give up your real email address.

You get an email, and instead of a sales pitch, he starts to tell a story.

The story engages you.

It moves you, tugs at your emotional heart strings. You can feel the story building up to
a climax. Then before you know it you’re at the end of a 1,100 word email … yet it didn’t
feel long at all.

It ended on a cliffhanger. WTF!

He says he’ll hit you up tomorrow to finish the story. And he’s STILL not sold you squat.
Yet you can feel that you’re getting closer to a solution.

You feel as if you’re a customer of his before you’ve even seen as order form. You
already know you’re going to buy whatever he’s selling.

You feel understood.

It’s amazing. Even strange.

Next day, right on queue, another email hits your inbox. You drop everything, open it,
and read every damn world.

No links. Nothing to buy.

You feel a level of trust and rapport has been established, and you can’t get enough.
You’re looking forward to seeing the damn order button. You’re anticipating it. You’re
excited as hell.

Finally on email #3 he offers up his solution for sale. It’s not a hard sell either (so
strange! you think).

The decision to buy is a no brainer.

Click. Buy.

What if marketing was where we began our journey towards understanding what people need and want?

## Traffic

Traffic = human beings.

People with a beating heart. Feelings, hopes, dreams, ambitions, and aspirations. Emotions. Fears. Needs.

1. Have a clear idea of who you want to talk to and do business with (and who you don't)
2. Craft your message and story. Build a process that creates better prospects.
3. **Traffic comes last**

Your product should solve a real problem. It's a solution for a specific group of people.
