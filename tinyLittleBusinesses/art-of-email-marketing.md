## Introduction

## Where Email Strategically Fits into The Big Picture

## Day 1: Principles + Framework First

### Values > Goal > Strategy > Tactics

1. Values (guiding star)
2. Goal/Function (of business)
3. Strategy
   1. How to achieve goal
   2. long-term
4. Tactics
   1. Actions taken to execute strategy
   2. Short-term & changeable

Values are fundamental beliefs (backed up and demonstrated by behavior)

**Follow up**: figure out company values.

A goal of making `X` happy customers/year is more effective than a monetary goal.

### The Email Engine

EE = SOS + NL + SPP/PLS

Every email is an asset, an opportunity to connect, to demonstrate value, to move the reader ina direction that benefits them, and you.

```text
                  ┌── NL  (M)
Email ─ SOS (A) ──┼── SPP (A)
                  └── PLS (M)              
```

- **Soap Opera Sequence (SOS)**
  - Quickly connect with someone, earn attention, then amp up that attention as a soap opera sequence plays out over an episodic narrative (similar to TV soap operas)
  - **Goal:** to rapidly bond with prospect and establish preeminence
- **Email Newsletter (NL)**
  - An asset - a single email - published on regular schedule that delivers value over the long-term (years~).
  - SOS starts the journey, newsletter continues it.
- **Story-Powered Promotion (SPP)**
  - SOS wrapped around an evergreen promotion (no hard open/close dates).
  - Framing happens first (people are asked to "raise their hand" before they receive the automated SPP)
  - serialized over 3-5 days.
  - Create multiple SPPs
- **Product Launch Sequence (PLS)**
  - Similar to SPP, but typically longer (5-14 days)
  - For a product with hard open and close date.
  - Written and delivered manually.

## Day 2: Relationship Marketing: The Soap Opera Sequence (SOS)

```text
E1  E2  E3  E4  E5  E6  E7  E8  E9
()--()--()--()--()--()--()--()--()-> [x]
```

The Soap Opera Sequence is the **work horse** of the email engine.

Entry point for _every_ subscriber, free and paid - no exceptions.

When done well, it can be a **magical experience** for the reader.

Earn their attention by taking them on a journey into your world.

Summary:

1. A follow-up sequence (autoresponder) — I use ConvertKit because it rocks!,
2. over a long enough series of email (more than four!),
3. that is story-driven (there’s a narrative arc across the sequence).
4. and earns attention and trust by demonstrating value, being preeminent, and helping people solve problems.
