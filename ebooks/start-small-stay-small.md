# Start Small, Stay Small

by: _Rob Walling_

## 1. The Chasm Between Developer and Entrepreneur

- **Micropreneur**: Entrepreneurs who want to remain solo.
- **Bootstrappers**: An Entrepreneur who has their vision set on something larger than a single person venture.
- Venture Capital isn't a bad thing, but seeking funding create two problems.
  1. Massive investment of time and focus distracts from making money and staying in business
  2. Modest success is nearly impossible because larger markets need to be pursued
- **Niche markets are critical for self-funded startups**. Start in a niche and scale up (if desired)
- **✹** The key factor in an entrepreneur's success is their ability to market their product.
- **✹** A developer who knows how to market a product is a rare (and powerful) combination

```text
Entrepreneur = developer + webmaster + marketer
```

- **Developer** - Technical know-how is a must for software entrepreneurship
- **Webmaster** - Need to know how to sell online: `HTML` or `CMS` knowledge is essential
- **Marketer** - Product _Last_. Marketing _First_.

**✹** Building something no one wants is probably the most common source of failure for entrepreneurs

Don't try to generate demand. Satisfy existing demand.

Verify the market, then build the product.

Define your goals and _write them down_!

Scale back information consumption (**HARD**)

Ask yourself:

> "Is this activity getting me closer to my launch date?"

**One of the biggest adjustments going from employee to entrepreneur is that time is your most precious commodity.**

- Dollarizing your time
  - Realize how much your time is worth
- Outsourcing is a bargain
  - $6/hour is cheap for menial tasks
- Keep work and play separate
  - Be deliberate about work time and free time to maximize the benefit of both
- Wasting time is bad
  - Keep a notebook with you to do high level thinking while waiting in lines
- Information consumption is only good when it produces something
  - _When reading blogs or books or listening to podcasts or audio books, take action notes_

### Transitioning from developer to entrepreneur

9 realizations during the process:

1. Being a Good Technician is Not Enough
   - Entrepreneur - dreamer, visionary, creative
   - Manager - thinks about ROI, near-term success, and productivity
   - Technician - gets work done, concerned about today's tasks
2. Market comes first, marketing second, aesthetic third, and functionality a distant fourth
   - Sizeable market, low competititon
   - Then better marketing wins
   - Then better design/aesthetic wins
   - Then functionality wins
3. Things will never be as clear as you want them to be
   - Writing code is cut and dry. Marketing is never as clear.
   - Get comfortable with guesswork
4. You can’t specify everything...but you do need a plan
   - \#1 advantage is reaction time
5. You need to fail fast and recover
   - I am going to fail _a lot_.
6. You will never be done
   - Get used to the feeling of never completing the product
7. Don’t expect instant gratification
   - When you launch is when the work really begins
8. Process is king
   - Document repeatable processes (for yourself or for outsourcing)
9.  Nothing about a startup is a one-time effort
    - Nearly everything requires ongoing effort
