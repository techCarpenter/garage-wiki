### 8. In what imaginary environment would your best self emerge?

Focus on your human environment: the kinds of people you'd like to be surrounded with, how much privacy you need, how much interaction, what kinds of responses to my ideas.

Don't change yourself in the fantasy exercise. Improve the world around you so your characteristics stop being problems. Don't think of things about yourself as weaknesses, think of them as design problems to challenge your ingenuity as a world-maker. Create an environment that fits and supports you AS YOU ARE.

### 9a. Your ideal day

With pen in hand and as much paper as you need (or a tape recorder if you prefer to dream out loud), take a leisurely walk through a day that would be perfect if it represented your usual days - not a vacation day, not a compromise day, but the very substance of your life as you’d love it to be. Live through that day in the present tense and in detail, from getting up in the morning to going to sleep at night.

What’s the first thing you do when you wake up? What do you have for breakfast? Do you make it yourself - or is it brought to you in bed, with a single rose and the morning paper? Do you take a long, hot bath? a bracing cold shower? What kinds of clothes do you put on? How do you spend the morning? the afternoon? At each time of day, are you indoors or outdoors, quiet or active, alone or with people? As you go through the hours of your fantasy day, there are three helpful categories to keep in mind: what, where, and who.

- _What_ are you doing? - what kind of work, what kind of play? Imagine yourself at the full stretch of your capacities. If you’d like to sing or sail, and you don’t know how, in this fantasy you do know how.
- _Where_? - in what kind of place, space, situation? A London flat, an Oregon farm, a fully quipped workshop, an elegant hotel room, a houseboat?
- _Who_ do you work with, eat with, laugh and talk with, sleep with? You will undoubtedly want to write some of your favorite real people into your fantasy; you might also want to include some types of people you’d like to be surrounded by - writers, musicians, children, people your own age, people of all different ages, athletes, Frenchmen, financiers, simple country people, celebrities, etc.

#### Morning

- I wake up at 5:30-6 next to my wife in our modest sized home on a large plot of land, drink some water, get dressed for the day.
- I walk alone or with 1 close person in the morning through the woods. Hear the birds chirping and watch the sun rise.
- Once I'm back from walking, I enjoy breakfast with my family. We eat eggs and toast with bacon, then hear everyone's plans for the day.
- By 8, I make my way to my home office. In the quiet, empty room I sit down for a time to work on my software product or write or plan my next project.
- I work until 12.

#### Afternoon

- At 12 I take lunch with my darling wife Hannah and kids. If the kids aren't in school, I eat lunch and play with them for a while, enjoying the time together as a family.
- When nap time approaches, I help Hannah get the younger ones down for nap. I then make my way to the workshop to work on my latest wood or metal project.
- I'm free to leave my workshop when I please to see a friend or pick the kids up from school or spend a relaxing afternoon with Hannah.
- By 4, I'm wrapping up in the workshop and heading in to the house. I help Hannah with dinner prep and we talk about our days. The kids are playing outside or in their bedrooms.

#### Evening

- We eat dinner shortly after 5pm at the table I built for the family. We all come together, thank the Lord for the day, and ask for his blessing.
- Dinner is more family time, sharing each others struggles and victories. We close dinner by reading from God's word and discussing it.
- After eating, we play outside or work on homework with the kids.
- After the kids go to bed, Hannah and I exercise and shower in our dual-head master bathroom shower!
- Then we relax and continue sharing experiences from the day. Watch a show or two before turning in to bed. We read for 30 minutes to an hour, pray together, and turn off the light.
