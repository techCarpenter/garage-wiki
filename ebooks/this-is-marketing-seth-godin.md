# This Is Marketing - Seth Godin

## Notes

### Chapter Four


1. Start with empathy to see a real need. Not an invented one, not "How can I start a business?" but, **"What would matter here?"**
2. Focus on the smallest viable market: "How few people could find this indispensable and still make it worth doing?"
3. Match the worldview of the people being served. Show up in the world with a story that they want to hear, told in a language they're eager to understand.
4. Make it easy to spread. If every member brings in one more member, within a few years, you'll have more members than you can count.
5. Earn, and keep, the attention and trust of those you serve.
6. Offer ways to go deeper. Instead of looking for members for your work, look for ways to do work for your members.
7. At every step along the way, create and relieve tension as people progress in their journeys toward their goals.
8. Show up, often. Do it with humility, and focus on the parts that work.

### Chapter Five

A lifeguard doesn't have to spend much time pitching to the drowning person. When you show up with a life buoy, if the drowning person understands what's at stake, you don't have to run ads to get them to hold on to it.

> People are waiting for you
> 
> They just don't know it yet.
> 
> They're waiting for the edge you will stake out, the one that they can imagine but don't expect.
> 
> They're waiting for the connection you will offer. The ability to see and be seen.
> 
> And they're waiting for the tension of the possible, the ability to make things better.
