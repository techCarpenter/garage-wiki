### Scales

[Scale info](https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/model-railroading-101-2382324#mntl-sc-block_2-0)

- The most popular scale choices:
  - O (1/48th)
  - HO (1/87.1)
  - N (1/160th)
  - Z (1/220th)
- Largest selling worldwide:
  1. HO (1/87.1)
  2. N (1/160th)
- All scales
  - Z Scale - `1:220` or 0.05 inch to 1 foot
  - N Scale - `1:160` or 0.075 inch to 1 foot
  - TT Scale - `1:120` or 0.1 inch to 1 foot
  - HO / OO Scale - `1:87` or 0.138 inch to 1 foot
  - S Scale - `1:64` or 0.1875 inch per 1 foot
  - O / O27 Scale - `1:48` or 0.25 inch per 1 foot
  - G / No. 1 Scale - `1:32` or 0.375 inch per 1 foot (there are other sizes of "G gauge" trains)
  - Standard Gauge - Model railway track sizes based on real-world standard gauge track
  - Narrow Gauge - Model railway track sizes based on real-world narrow gauge track

### Track types

[Track type info](https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/model-railroad-track-types-2382056)

- Track Codes
  - Defined by the NMRA
  - Represents the height of the rails in thoursandths of an inch
    - i.e. `Code 55` is 0.055 inches high
  - Scales and codes
    - O Scale: 125, 100
    - HO Scale: 100, 83, 70, 55
    - N Scale: 80, 55, 40
    - Z Scale: 55, 40
  - Transition joints required when connecting rails of different codes
- Rail metals
  - Most common "nickel silver"
    - Doesn't oxidize as quickly
  - Other metals:
    - steel (less desirable)
    - brass (less desirable)
    - aluminum
- Integrated roadbed vs. standard track
  - IR track generally preferred
- Flex track
  - allows for more layouts
  - more reliable operation
  - doesn't come with integrate roadbed
- Switches
  - aka. turnouts or points
  - See [track switches](#track-switches)

### Track Switches

[Track switch info](https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/model-train-switches-2382606)

1. By the numbers
   - Model switches sized by frog number
     - Larger number = longer switch
     - **Example:** if it takes four inches of length for the tracks to separate one inch, it's a No. 4 frog (or switch)
   - typically No. 8 or larger
   - _most switches are not a consistent curve radius_
2. Wyes
   - Both routs diverge away from each other (like a `Y`)
3. Curved switches
   - both routes curve in same direction, one sharper than the other
4. Slip and double slip
   - AKA "puzzle switches"
   - Look more like a diamond or crossing
   - Shaped like an "X"
   - Only used if space is very tight or if you want to throw something interesting into an industrial yard
5. 3-Way
   - 2 switches in one!
   - one route goes left, one right, and one straight down the middle
6. Spring switches
   - a coiled spring keeps tieh switch in the "normal" position
   - seldom used though
