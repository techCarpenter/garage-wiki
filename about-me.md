## Ideas

- Wander on purpose
- Deviate from the focused course (when appropriate)
- > "Actively cultivate inefficiency" - _Range_ by David Epstein
- Just because you _can_ doesn't mean you _should_
  - Tech related things...
- Software is just connecting invisible pipelines together and mapping information to the correct locations
- Communicating career goals with current coworkers
  - Tension of loving the people you work with currently, but wanting to move career in a different direction
