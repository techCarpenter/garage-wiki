    - I saw your introduction post, and you mentioned that you create websites for small businesses. I was wondering how much you charge for your services? We are looking for someone to create a website for an attorney at a reasonable rate. All of the website developers we've talked to so far are not a good fit for us because they deal with much bigger companies that sell large amounts of actual products rather than services. We only have one attorney starting their own law firm, so it would not be too complicated (I don't think, anyway). Thank you in advance for your time! Hope to hear from you soon. Cara Thaler

    - We are not happy with our website. Our person oversold their qualifications.   So, I'd like to talk to you are fixing the screw ups. It needs to integrate with our law practice management software. We are a new firm, 2 friends that have combined resources. Call me and let me know if you can help us. I can explain it better on the phone and answer your questions.  Maureen Van Hoven

Hi Cara,

Sorry for the delayed response, I haven't checked Nextdoor for a bit!
