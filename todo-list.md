    - I saw your introduction post, and you mentioned that you create websites for small businesses. I was wondering how much you charge for your services? We are looking for someone to create a website for an attorney at a reasonable rate. All of the website developers we've talked to so far are not a good fit for us because they deal with much bigger companies that sell large amounts of actual products rather than services. We only have one attorney starting their own law firm, so it would not be too complicated (I don't think, anyway). Thank you in advance for your time! Hope to hear from you soon. Cara Thaler

      Hi Cara,

      Sorry for the delayed response, I haven't checked Nextdoor for a bit. I typically do a rate based on what kind of site the client wants built. A small static site will cost less than a dynamic site with a database and server.

      I appreciate you reaching out! I would be happy to talk more, possibly over the phone or email? Here is my contact info.

      I'd like to hear more about the site requirements before making any commitments or giving a quote.

      I look forward to hearing from you!

I can explain it better on the phone and answer your questions. Maureen Van Hoven
