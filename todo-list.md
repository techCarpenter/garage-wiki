## Essentialism 21-day challenge

1. Write down the most important six activities for today. Put them in priority order. Now cross off the bottom five.
2. Spend one day watching for when you use the words, “I have to.” Replace them with, “I choose to.”
3. Pause once to day and ask, “Is this the most important or valuable thing I could be doing right now?”
4. Catch yourself when the thought crosses your mind, “I will do both.” When you do: stop, pause and pick one of the choices.
5. Ask, “How can I double my results with half the effort?” Answers will come.
6. Create a room at home where there is no technology.
7. Spend time playing with a child for 20 minutes. Lose yourself in the magical exploration that comes so easily to children.
8. Take a 6 minute nap. Add 5-10 minutes to fall asleep.
9. Today, if it isn’t a clear yes then make it a clear no.
10. Before going into your next meeting, pause and ask yourself, “What is the one thing I really want to achieve coming out of this meeting?”
11. Identify a person you find it particularly hard to say no to. Script a graceful no. Carefully word it. Practice it.
12. Look at each commitment on your calendar for today. Ask “If I wasn’t already involved how hard would I work to get involved now?”
13. Establish a new rule for today: if you want to add a new activity you need to edit out two existing activities.
14. Next time anyone asks you for anything, just pause. I’m not saying you have to say no. But at least just pause first.
15. Design a bedtime routine that relaxes you.
16. Design a morning routine that invigorates you.
17. Start your next meeting with the question: “What has gone right since we last met?”
18. Today, stop what you are doing every 30 minutes to write down what you did in the last half an hour.
19. Once today, pause and ask yourself three questions: Where am I right now? What is happening right now? What is important right now?
20. Start an essentialist journal: you’re only allowed one sentence for the whole day.
21. Schedule a Personal Quarterly Offsite to reflect on the big picture.
