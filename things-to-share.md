     - It's not made great by accolades or praise from your peers... but by the experience of the people who use it.
  2. Great work can be done **by anyone**
     - You don't have to be an expert, just find what people truly need
  3. Great work is **shipped work**
     - For your work to help people, you need to get it into their hot little hands
  4. Great work is work you can **keep doing**
     - Great work takes care of you so you can take care of it
  5. Great work is **never done**
     - Nothing can be perfect. Every time you add to your work or try again, it'll become greater

## Be as necessary as an auto mechanic

When my car has a problem, I don't hesitate to schedule the mechanic to check it out. It's less painful to part with the money than to fix it myself (at this point in my life). I likely could fix it myself, but it would take longer and the quality would be lower.

The same can be said for websites. Most people _could_ build a site themselves, but it would take longer (potentially **much** longer) and look amateur.

These are the skills that are necessary to some extent for building a custom website.

- CSS
- HTML
- Javascript
- SEO
- Domain setup
- Site hosting
- Email setup
- Custom design
- Contact forms

## Sharing knowledge is like teaching someone to ride a bike

It's silly to think that only an expert bicyclist can teach children how to ride a bike.

In fact, I taught all my siblings how to ride a 2-wheeler. I wasn't that far ahead of them, but I could do something they couldn't so I showed them how.

The same is true for anything else. If you are even 1 step ahead of someone else, you can bring them up to your level. Chances are you're more than 1 step ahead of someone out there.

## Treat url like database query with Javascript

Found on [Derek Sivers' site](https://sive.rs/thanks?for=list)

```javascript
var msg = {
  list:
    'I updated your email list settings.</p><p>Your info is private and will never be sold to anyone else, ever.</p><p>Of course you can email me anytime at <a href="mailto:derek@sivers.org">derek@sivers.org</a>',
  reset:
    "Wait a minute, then check your inbox for an email from derek@sivers.org with the subject “your password reset link”.</p><p>If you don’t get it in a minute or two, please email me to let me know.",
  bq: "I’ll let you know as soon as the books are ready.",
  done: "All done."
};
var m = /\?for=([a-z0-9]+)/.exec(location.search);
if (m && msg[m[1]]) {
  document.getElementById("msg").innerHTML = msg[m[1]];
}
```
