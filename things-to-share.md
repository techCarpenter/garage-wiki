## Be as necessary as an auto mechanic

When my car has a problem, I don't hesitate to schedule the mechanic to check it out. It's less painful to part with the money than to fix it myself (at this point in my life). I likely could fix it myself, but it would take longer and the quality would be lower.

The same can be said for websites. Most people _could_ build a site themselves, but it would take longer (potentially **much** longer) and look amateur.

These are the skills that are necessary to some extent for building a custom website.

- CSS
- HTML
- Javascript
- SEO
- Domain setup
- Site hosting
- Email setup
- Custom design
- Contact forms
